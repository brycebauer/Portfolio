<h1>Lab 5: CSS</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>
  The purpose of this lab is to give you hands-on experience with external
  CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) stylesheets.  You should use a text editor
  such as Notepad++ to do this assignment.
</p>

<h2>Partners</h2>

<p>
  Everyone is required to work with a partner. If you understand CSS, 
  sharing your knowledge with someone else will benefit both you and 
  your partner.
</p>

<h2>Preliminaries</h2>

<ul>
  <li>On a thumb drive, personal drive, or Z drive create a directory named <b>lab5</b>.
      Pull up today's lab web page in a separate tab by control-clicking on
      this <a href="lab5CSS.html">link</a>.  You will know you have done
      this correctly if the tab's title is <i>Lab 5: CSS</i>. 
      View the source of this file and save it to a file named 
      <b>index.html</b> that is
      located in the <b>lab5</b> directory.</li>
  <li>Create a subdirectory in <b>lab5</b> named <b>css</b>.</li>
  <li>Create a subdirectory in <b>lab5</b> named <b>images</b>.</li>
  <li>Notice that there is an external stylesheet link in index.html
      that references a file named index.css that is located in the
      <b>css</b> subdirectory.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirements and Grading - 10 points</h2>

<p>
  The following requirements should all be accomplished by modifying the 
  index.css stylesheet. <b>Do not modify the index.html document.</b>
</p>

<ul>

  <li>1 point.  All level 1 header text, &lt;h1&gt;, should appear as 
      sans-serif text that is 50 pixels high, has a background color of 
      rgb(230,230,190) and is centered.</li>
  <li>2 points.  All level 2 header text, &lt;h2&gt;, should appear as serif 
      text that is 30 pixels high, has a background color of #ff0000, is 
      italicized, is in the small-caps font variant and has a 5 pixel spacing 
      between each character (I didn't cover this in class but it is in the tutorial, easy to find).</li>
  <li>1 point.  The background image takes up the whole page and is a repeated 
      version of the pattern listed in the Useful Resources section below.  
      Name this image <b>prettyPattern.gif</b> and store it in the <b>images</b>
      subdirectory.</li>
  <li>1 point.  The spacing between each word that appears after a 
      bullet in a list is 5 pixels.  Hint: use the CSS Reference link

      font weight of 900.</li>

      document should be blue in color.</li>
