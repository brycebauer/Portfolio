The Photo:

I used a picture that I took during the summer, while I was up at Hyalite Canyon.  While I was up there getting ready for a bonfire, at the resivor, I noticed that the mountains and water looked stunning.  I decided that this would be a good time to test out the camera on my new Galaxy S5.  One of the main reasons I like this picture is that it shows me how beautiful Montana can be.  Another reason is that no matter how far away I move after graduating, this will show me where I came from.
