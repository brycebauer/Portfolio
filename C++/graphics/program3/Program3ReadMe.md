Program 3

Why:
	I created my world to be a castle sytle corridor with 6 rooms and a hole to get into
the upper room where there are objects from program 2.  I chose to do this because I am very
interested in medievil architecture and medievil times.  The objects in the 6 rooms are
minecraft themed because I started playing minecraft this semester and loved that I could
build whatever I want.  I created the objects in this room because they are objects and
characters that are used and found in minecraft.  The 10 objects that are from program 2 have
different configurations that create 10 objects.  I decided to give these squares the texture
of a circuit board because I wanted to give another interest I have.  This is the interest in
technology.

How program works:
	I have the user run around the corridor and can't go through any of the walls, floor,
ceiling, and door.  The first floor is for special objects with different textures that are
the 10 basic object required.  There are 3 lights that give a little, not alot, light onto the
different heads mounted on spears.  My choice of lighting for the world is to make the world
seem like there are no shadows.  To get to the top floor there is a small square hole in the
ceiling.  To get up there you can either go into flight mode or use the spacebar to move the
camera position up.  The upper floor consists of 10 objects from program 2 that are positioned
around the room.  These objects each have special configurations for them.  The user can make
the number of rows increase or decrease, which will increase or decrease the number of squares
used to make some of the objects.  The user can also increase the scaling in the x-axis, y-axis,
and/or z-axis on most of the objects.

Keys used:
	A: Walk left
	S: Walk backwards
	D: Walk right
	W: Walk forward
	Shift: Go down
	Space: Go up (used to go to the top room without activating fly mode)
	Tab: Toggles fly mode
	Q: Hold for Quicksilver mode (super fast)
	R: Hold for run
	T: Hold for turtle speed
      	REST OF KEYS ARE USED FOR TOP ROOM
	U: Increase scale on the x-axis
	I: Decrease scale on the x-axis
	J: Increase scale on the y-axis
	K: Decrease scale on the y-axis
	N: Increase scale on the z-axis
	M: Decrease scale on the z-axis
	Up: Increases number of rows
	Down: Decreases number of rows
